# 3-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a 
list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as 
"I would like to own a Honda motorcycle."

vehicles = ['Dodge Hellcat', 'Boeing 747', 'Sikorsky Helicopter', 'Ford Mustang', 'Delorean DMC-12']

print(f"I would like to own a {vehicles[1]}.")
print(f"I would like to own a {vehicles[2]}.")
print(f"I would like to own a {vehicles[3]}.")
print(f"I would like to own a {vehicles[4]}.")
