# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person's name, 
print a message to them. The text of each messsage should be the same, but each message should be personalized 
with the person's name.

names = ['Ben', 'Peter', 'Jaxon', 'Sebastian', 'Jason']

print(f"I have a friend named {names[0]}.")
print(f"I have a friend named {names[1]}.")
print(f"I have a friend named {names[2]}.")
print(f"I have a friend named {names[3]}.")
print(f"I have a friend named {names[4]}.")
